            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Touching the first Article, beginning,</hi> First it is said, that the libertie, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>SEeing that the whole substance of the Article, onely retaineth this point, that the countrey after fortie yeares times of warre may be brought to peace and freedome: it is before all other things necessary, that the soueraigntie may be declared and set downe, with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, cleare, and no doubtfull words, in regard that the King of Spaine may otherwise at all times seeke his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Now euery man that is of a sound iudgement, may well vnderstand, that the words which men seeke to make vs beleeue, do in no sort containe nor include that which we desire. For we seek not, neither is there any need of declaring or manifesting of our freedome, or of a free state, because that we were alwayes free vnder our Princes that lawfully ruled ouer vs according to the lawes and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of these countries, but wholy to get out of the long and continuall warre that hath bin holden therein. Therefore it is requisite that our aduerse parties should clearely set downe their meaning, that they promise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to pretend any thing touching the soueraigntie of these countries. For without that, we can haue no hope at any time to liue peaceably, as by all resolutions made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this proposition, it was manifestly vnderstood: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that which they promise vnto vs, without the said de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, serues to no other end, then to depend vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and to bring these countries vnder subiection, and the rather, because the words, not to pretend any thing touching our freedome, take not away the pretence touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the soueraigntie, in respect that the freedome and the soueraigntie are two seuerall things; and withall that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is contained in the treatie, doth expire with the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:2994:3"/>of the truce. So that the whole Treatie, after it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, is esteemed as not to haue bin made, vnlesse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the point <hi>for euer</hi> might be expresly vrged; and the rather, for that the Popes Nuncios lying in France, and the Iesuites vse all the meanes they can, to the end that this forme set downe by the Ambassadours, might be found to be good and sufficient, therefore also this word <hi>for euer</hi> ought the rather to be required, in regard that in treaties of peace c≈çmonly there is an article inserted, that the same shall continue for euer. But for that in a treatie of truce, the words <hi>for euer</hi> are not set downe, thereby the soueraigntie also is pretended to end and to cease with the expiration of the truce. And the States meaning is, that the soueraigntie shall continue for euer; but the Deputies of the Archduke haue roundly and manifestly declared the contrary, that is, that their Masters vnderstand that the same shall continue no longer then the time of the truce.</p>

                  <hi>Touching the Article beginning,</hi> It is also to be considered, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WE seeke not for any grant or gift of freedome, as knowing manifestly that we haue the same of our selues; but herein it is spoken of ceasing from armes, and of reducing the country into securitie: which cannot be done, vnlesse the King of Spaine doth wholy renounce his pretence of soueraigntie ouer these countries <hi>for euer.</hi> For that he which this day pretendeth nothing, the next day may pretend some thing; whereby we may see the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and danger contained in the aforesaid forme and manner of proceeding.</p>

               <p>WHat doth this otherwise pretend, then that we should acknowledge the Archduke, or to speake plainly,
<pb facs="tcp:2994:3"/>the King of Spaine for oursoueraign Lord: which maketh vs by all reason to feare, that this truce shall serue onely for a preparation. And whereunto can the same otherwise tend, but that when the enemie shall once haue put vs out of doubt and suspition, and redressed his state and reuenue, he may fall vpon vs, and bring our country into vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, without any meanes for vs to relieue our selues in any maner, which in truth is his onely desiring and purpose. It being worth the noting, that the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did not content himselfe peaceably and quietly to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed and freely possessed the country of Flanders for the spake of 70 yeares, but also that he compelled <hi>Francis</hi> the first, King of France, to renounce the soueraigntie thereof, and that in another maner then is here set downe vnto vs.</p>

               <p>THis point is answered before in the first and second Article, in this manner: That it is specially needfull that the soueraigntie should be well expressed, in respect of the nature of the truce; which being expired, all ceaseth; as also the country is full of it selfe, and cannot be secured, vnlesse the King of Spaine doth renounce and abandon his pretence thereunto.</p>

               <p>THe Article touching the Soueraigntie, is not onely made by the premeditated aduice of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, but also by the same not sufficiently set downe, but rather to be esteemed of no force, without the words, for the present and future time, and for them and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors: it being alwayes formerly declared, that in the treatie of truce we must consequently and necessarily haue the said soueraigntie <hi>for euer.</hi>

And which is more, not onely the Archdukes are to hold their promises, but also the King of Spaine hath expresly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by his act of aggregation, bearing date the 18 of September 1607. to obserue and keepe, and cause to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and kept, all and euery point, as well touching the truce, as the peace, binding himselfe thereunto by his princely word, together with all generall and particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation and acquitald necessary and belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Whereupon the Deputies, as well in the name of the Archdukes, as of the King of Spaine, haue by the treatie of peace agreed vnto the article of Soueraigntie, in such manner and forme as it standeth, which is farre otherwise then it is now set downe vnto vs.</p>

               <p>NO man desireth, that in regard of this feare, the warre may continue, but those that know the humors and practises of the enemie, as also the manner of our state, ought not to reiect this inconuenience.</p>

               <p>THis is certainly to be cared for, lest any misfortune should happen. Yet the enemie hath not so good an oportunitie to practise his subtill pretences in the time of warre, as when it is truce; because in time of warre all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation ceaseth.

               <p>THe weakning of our trafficks which truce bringeth with it, and the lessening of our contributions which will follow, will not hinder vs from sparing some things for other matters: and also if it should be so, that a great part of our souldiers should be discharged, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse cannot be done without some great hazard of our state, which is farre from that, that we might spare more then the one halfe, and the necessitie or want of meanes which men propound, is none such that it should be the cause of the totall ruine of these countries by a sheete of paper, seeing that in former times it hath bin found, that God did not reiect our righteous cause for want of means: besides that the seruices which men continually shall then pay, will also amount vnto a great summe of mony, that in some consideration they may well be esteemed to be able to defray the charges of an armie in the field.</p>

               <p>Therefore our meaning and speciall aime is, to be well secured in these countries by the Truce, that at the least the Soueraigntie may be set in a good, cleare, sufficient forme, such as the same shall not onely continue, and haue and hold her force for the time of the Truce, but also for euer after the expiration thereof: and that the same shall not be shadowed nor couered ouer with captiousnesse and double meanings, but made with the same words, according to the foote of the beginning therereof, wifely and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent taken by the resolutions of the 24 of April, the second of Nouember, and the 23 of December in the last yeares and the prorogation touching the breaking off of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace, dated the 24 of August, and the acts of the 13 of September last past; as also the aduice of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours giuen touching the Soueraigntie, and likewise the obligation and renouncing contained in the acts, not only from the King of Spaine, but also from the Archduke.
